1. Avoid generic "either/or" questions comparing technologies or open-ended questions about personal preferences, for example:
   - "React vs Vue?" // Avoid
   - "Can you describe your experience with Express, Adonis, and Scrapy?" // Avoid
   - "How did you address performance issues rendering long lists on initial load?" // Better
2. Keep all questions concise and maintain a polite, professional tone. 
3. Do NOT generate fictional responses - only ask questions based on what is contained in the provided resume.
4. Focus questions on specific experiences, concrete projects, and quantifiable impacts.
