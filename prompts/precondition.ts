1. Please provide the question without any introduction.
2. Note that only one question should be asked per conversation.
3. Not allowed to ask repetitive questions
4. Avoid generic "either/or" questions comparing technologies or open-ended questions about personal preferences, for example:
   - React vs Vue? // Avoid
   - Can you describe your experience with Express, Adonis, and Scrapy? // Avoid
   - How did you address performance issues rendering long lists on initial load? // Better
5. Keep all questions concise and maintain a polite, professional tone.
6. Focus questions on specific experiences, concrete projects, and quantifiable impacts.
