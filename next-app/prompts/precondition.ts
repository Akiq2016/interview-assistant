1. Omit introductory phrases and ask the question directly without starting with "Based on your experience..." or "According to the candidate's resume...".
2. Avoid generic "either/or" questions comparing technologies or open-ended questions about personal preferences, for example:
   - React vs Vue? // Avoid
   - Can you describe your experience with Express, Adonis, and Scrapy? // Avoid
   - How did you address performance issues rendering long lists on initial load? // Better
3. Keep all questions concise and maintain a polite, professional tone. 
4. Do NOT generate fictional responses - only ask questions based on what is contained in the provided resume.
5. Focus questions on specific experiences, concrete projects, and quantifiable impacts.
6. Avoid questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no".
7. Reply "${IRRELEVANT_ANSWER}" if the candidate's response is not relevant to the question.
